# Misc

This folder will contain all the miscellaneous files that are not directly related to the project. This includes the project proposal, project report, and any other files that are not directly related to the code.

Any artifacts that are generated via build processes should not be stored in this folder. Instead, they should be stored in the `build` folder.

This folder can contain subfolders if necessary. For example, you may want to create a `docs` folder to store documentation files.
